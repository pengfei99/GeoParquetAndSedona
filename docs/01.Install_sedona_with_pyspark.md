# Install sedona with python/pyspark

Sedona is a framework which can do geospatial calculation. It can work on top of the spark. In this tutorial, we will
show how to make sedona works with pyspark

## Prerequisite

- Install jdk
- Install spark and pyspark.

## Install apache-sedona python API

```shell
# Since Sedona v1.1.0, pyspark is an optional dependency of Sedona Python because spark comes pre-installed on 
# many spark platforms. To install pyspark along with Sedona Python in one go, use the spark extra
pip install apache-sedona[spark]
```

## Prepare sedona-spark jar

Sedona Python needs one additional jar file called `sedona-spark-shaded` or `sedona-spark` to work properly. 
Please make sure you use the correct version for Spark and Scala.

For Spark 3.0 to 3.3 and Scala 2.12, it is called `sedona-spark-shaded-3.0_2.12-1.5.1.jar` or `sedona-spark-3.0_2.12-1.5.1.jar`

For Spark 3.4+ and Scala 2.12, it is called `sedona-spark-shaded-3.4_2.12-1.5.1.jar` or `sedona-spark-3.4_2.12-1.5.1.jar`. 
> If you are using Spark versions higher than 3.4, please replace the 3.4 in artifact names with the corresponding major.minor version numbers.

Another jar is the `geotools-wrapper`

## Create a sedona session
